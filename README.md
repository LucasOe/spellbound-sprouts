# Spellbound Sprouts

"Spellbound Sprouts" is a mixture of farming and tower defense game. During the day, the player cultivates plants, which must be defended from skeletons and spiders at night. It is important to build up a strong defense to protect your herbs from enemies.

## How does it work?

The game is divided into two phases. In the day phase, the player can grow new plants and herbs and prepare for the night. The plants help the player to defend themselves from enemies. The herbs can be sacrificed in the cauldron to progress in the game and unlock new plants. In the night phase, skeletons and spiders try to destroy the seeds.

The day phase lasts one minute, but can be skipped if necessary when the player has finished their preparations. The night phase lasts until all enemies have been defeated.

The player has won the game as soon as they have collected enough herbs and enemy drops to brew the last potion. If the player fails to do so within 35 days or dies at the hands of the enemies, the game is lost. One run takes between 20 and 30 minutes.
